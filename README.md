# Linear Mixed Modelling Web application

A user-friendly web application designed to help users **fit and analyse Linear Mixed Effect Models (LMEMs)** using their own datasets — all without needing to write any code.

This tool is especially helpful for:
- Students and researchers new to statistical modelling
- Users with little to no programming experience
- Quick, exploratory analysis on custom datasets

---

## 🌟 Features

- 📁 Upload your own `.csv` dataset
- 🧮 Fit linear mixed models with fixed and random effects
- 📊 View model summaries and statistical output
- 🎛️ Intuitive interface – no coding required

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1 Install Python 
make sure python is installed in your computer You can download it from:
👉 https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

### 2 Download the project 
You can get the project files by cloning the GitHub repository:
1)Open a terminal or command prompt
2)Run the following command : git clone https://github.com/xmashalx/Group-software-project.git
3) navigate into the project folder: cd Group-software-project

### 3 Create a virtual environemnt (optional but recomended)
On Windows
run the following commands:
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux
run the following commands:
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

### 4 Install the required packages
run the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

### 5 run the application 
streamlit run gsp_app.py

### 6 Using the web application 
To test the Linear Mixed Modelling Web Application, you’ll need a dataset to upload. 
For demonstration purposes, you can use the sleepstudy.csv dataset — a commonly used dataset in linear mixed-effects modeling.
You can download the dataset from the following link: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/lme4/sleepstudy.csv
Once you have the dataset, upload it to the web application when prompted, select your variables, and start fitting your model.
There is a user guide on the website to help you if you get stuck
